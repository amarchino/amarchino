Currently 
- I'm interested in front-end development via new frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), back-end development via stable technologies (mainly Java and Node.js).\
I'm also greatly interested in literature from all over the world and trying to learn to read in its original language
- I'm currently learning new and improved ways to handle the technologies I already know, and I'am always interested in new technologies to solve real-life problems
